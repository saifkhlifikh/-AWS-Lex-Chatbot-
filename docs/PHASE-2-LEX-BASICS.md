## Creating Your First Bot in AWS Lex Console
Follow these steps to create your first bot in the AWS Lex Console:
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to AWS Lex.
3. Create a new bot and follow the prompts.

## Understanding Intents (What Users Want)
Intents represent the goal of the user’s request. For example, if a user says ‘Book a flight’, the intent could be ‘BookFlight’.

## Understanding Utterances (How Users Say Things)
Utterances are examples of what users might say to invoke their intents, such as 'I want to book a flight'.

## Understanding Slots (Important Details to Collect)
Slots are the individual pieces of information that the bot needs to fulfill the user’s request, like destination or date.

## Building a Simple Greeting Bot Step-by-Step
